                    Mentioned on my cover, my name is Esona Gilikidi and situated in a local town known as Khayelitsha. Describing myself I would say that I'm an active person who enjoys sports and traveling when I'm going out. Going out, I like to hike if time agrees on the side and as sport on the that hand, later you will notice my cv and it'll also tell you that I'm into soccer and basketball. Between the 2, soccer prefer to follow up on it and do read ups as for basketball I perticipate in it.</p>

                    As you can see, this is my personal website. I am currently am in a programme that offers leanership in <b>Website and Application programming</b>. In that I would aslo describe myself as a person who can adapt easy to dfferent situations, I love learning something new, especially if it benefit in education. During my extra time, I read up on online articles, spend time catching up on my studies. Not only I am doing this coding learnership but am continuing my studies at a collage located in Rondeboach and is known as IIE Versity Collage</p>

                    One thing I would admire myself about is the quick to adapt to different situations. Like Mentioned earlier on, I am that guy who loves learning new things, skills, knowledge. So adaptation is much easy for me as I become eager to learn this. In terms of education, stated I am in an institution and there I am studying the world of finance. Future I wish to study <u>Accounting</u> archieveing qualifications for it, currently am doing a business management and accounting study to archieve my desired qualification. Reason for choosing that path, people around close to me made me realise how good I can be towards money. <br>
                    In the coding department, I learned it because I always had a want to learn something; a portion in the <i>'IT'</i> feild. The bootcamp was an opportunity knocking on my door so I decided to go for it, which that in the end woke a passion in my I never thought I had <u>Coding</u>. Now here I am doing my porfolio, show casing the skill I recently learned during my time in the bootcamp.  </p>
